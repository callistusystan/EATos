# EATos

:hamburger::pizza:

EATos is a decentralized application (DAPP) hosted on EOS with the aim to reduce global food wastage. We extend the supply chain use case, giving consumers the ability to sell their groceries in a peer-to-peer marketplace as well as to donate to food banks or charities. 

This project was built in 26 hours during the EOS Global Hackathon Sydney 2018.
